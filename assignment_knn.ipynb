        "4. What are overfitting and underfitting?\n",
        "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and performs well on training data but poorly on new data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why does splitting the data into training and testing sets, and choosing $k$ by evaluating accuracy or SSE on the test set, improve model performance?\n",
