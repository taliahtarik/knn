        "4. What are overfitting and underfitting?\n",
        "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and performs well on training data but poorly on new data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why does splitting the data into training and testing sets, and choosing $k$ by evaluating accuracy or SSE on the test set, improve model performance?\n",
        "Splitting data into training and testing sets ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.\n",

        "6. With classification, we can report a class label as a prediction or a probability distribution over class labels. Please explain the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",
        "Reporting a class label is simple and clear but lacks confidence information. A probability distribution provides insight into uncertainty but may be harder to interpret."
